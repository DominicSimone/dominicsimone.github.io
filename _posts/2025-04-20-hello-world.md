I setup this devlog using github pages, jekyll, and gemini. I think the template gemini generated for me was garbage. But I don't know how to fix it, so it will stay until I get annoyed with it.

I originally wanted to host a static site on a raspberry pi, with tiny file sizes and a fast file serving software that would let me get away with a fanless server that sat in a corner of my office. I wanted to write, and I wanted to create games. I think I still want to do these things.
